# SCIEToday
## About

This repository holds a Android-native rewrite of [SCIEToday by Jingcheng Yang](https://github.com/SCIEDEV/SCIEToday), which is a
mobile client for SCIE CMS. Currently in an alpha state, about half of the UI is completed, but the
code to connect to CMS has not been started on.

It's written in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose, the modern Android UI framework, and uses Material
Design 3.
